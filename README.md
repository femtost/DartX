# DartX

Dart Crossplatform with WebView. 


# Purpose

Dart is the **best-of-both-world** language for statictyped speed (similar to C/C++) 
and dynamictyped flexibility (similar to JS).

JS(minimal)/HTML/CSS is for fast and **flexible UI** development.


# Tech Stack

Backend (Logic)
  - Dart (with some features from Flutter but not Flutter UI)

Frontend (WebView)
  - JS(minimal)/HTML/CSS


# How to Use

Android

Windows
  - `webview.dll`: github.com/webview/webview
      - Use 'pip install webview_python'
      - Run 'python', import webview_python once or twice
      - Go to the pip package webview_python to get *webview.dll & WebView2Loader.dll*
